# Quick Start Guide

Get your Maldives Excursion Platform running in 5 minutes!

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages for both frontend and backend.

## Step 2: Set Up Database

```bash
npm run setup
```

This creates the SQLite database and adds:
- Admin account: `admin@maldives.com` / `admin123`
- Sample provider: `provider@example.com` / `provider123`
- 3 sample trips in Male

## Step 3: Start the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts both the backend (port 3001) and frontend (port 3000) servers.

## Step 4: Access the Platform

Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:3000**
